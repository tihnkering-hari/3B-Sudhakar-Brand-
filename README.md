## About [Basics]

The 3B Model analyzes brand alignment across three dimensions:

- **Being**: Your authentic identity
- **Behaving**: Your actual actions  
- **Broadcasting**: Your perceived image

## The GIST

### An Outside-In Diagnostic Framework

The 3B Model provides a practical framework for diagnosing and fixing brand misalignment in growing organizations. Unlike traditional brand tools that work Inside-Out, starting with what a company wants to be and pushing that message outward, the 3B Model works **Outside-In**, starting with what the world actually perceives.

**The core**: A brand is not what an organization says it is. It's what it consistently does, as experienced by others. Once a brand is in motion, it sends thousands of signals daily. . . through customer interactions, employee behaviors, social media mentions, and unplanned revelations. The only way to truly know your brand is to start from the outside and work backward to the source.

The model operates through three interconnected elements:

- **Being** (identity/values)
- **Behaving** (actions/culture)
- **Broadcasting** (signals/perception)

By starting with Broadcasting [mapping what the world actually sees through planned and unplanned, controlled and uncontrolled signals] teams can trace problems back to their behavioral sources and ultimately to identity misalignments. This Outside-In approach reveals truth rather than aspiration, making it particularly powerful for organizations experiencing growth, where the gap between internal belief and external reality often widens invisibly.
